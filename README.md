# REST-API-Node.js-User-Login-Registration
This is node.js API I have been working on I really wanted to dive deep in into creating a user login registration with password 
encryption and JWT for user verification. I am currently building the front end of this app with react using Chart.js to
display users weights so they can track it. This will be for a fitness
tracking app. 

if A user has an account when they log in they are issued a http only jwt. I need to refactor the way a user can add their weight.
